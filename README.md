PIC12F1572 has being my hobby for a while.
Reasons are that it is a low pin-count microcontroller, and, 
  the ease of programming via helping from Microchip Code Composer (MCC).
You can try playing functions provided in the MCU within a couple of hours,
  without to swallow the whole datasheet.

Let's try it!
